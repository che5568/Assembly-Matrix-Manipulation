# Matrix Manipulation in Assembly Language

This project demonstrates matrix manipulation in assembly language. It prompts the user to enter elements for a matrix, copies the matrix in reverse order, performs matrix multiplication, and displays the results.

## Features:

- Interactive user input for matrix elements.
- Copying of a matrix in reverse order.
- Matrix multiplication algorithm using nested loops.
- Output of matrices and results for visualization.

## Usage:

1. Assemble and run the code using an x86 assembly language compiler (e.g., MASM).
2. Enter elements for the matrix M1 when prompted.
3. View the original matrix M1, its reverse copy M2, and the resulting matrix MP.
4. Analyze the code to understand loop structures and matrix manipulation.

## Requirements:

- Irvine32.inc
- x86 assembly language compiler (e.g., MASM)
